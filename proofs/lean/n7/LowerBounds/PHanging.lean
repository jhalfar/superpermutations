# Hanging components (`opt/lb/lean/PROOF_5899.md`, sections 4, 6 and 7)

* `famH H`: the trails that a hanging component contributes to the family of the configuration:
  its trails (paid attachment); its trails with the last one glued to the first (free
  attachment, at least one heavy seam); its inner rows (closed chain of at least 3 rows);
  nothing otherwise.
* `epsH H`: the excess of its link costs over 1 per link.
* `famH_spec` (Lemma FAM): these are trails with blocks among those of `H`, and
  `vH H + 5 epsH H ≤ Σ (rows - holes - 5)`, `Σ (holes + 6) + 6 epsH H ≤ wH H`.
* `hanging_item`: if `epsH H = 0` and `H` contributes at most 5 trails, the value of `H` is at
  most the item table at its weight (given the caps).
