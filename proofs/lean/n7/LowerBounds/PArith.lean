# The arithmetic for 5,899 (`opt/lb/lean/PROOF_5899.md`, sections 5 and 7)

Everything here is about the tables of `PTables.lean` and lists of numbers; no rows, no words.
The closed statements about the tables are proved by `decide +kernel` (evaluation in the kernel,
no `native_decide`).

* (B) `profile_of_family`: pairs `(holes, rows)` with `rows ≤ M holes`, `Σ (holes + 6) ≤ 84` and
  `Σ (rows - holes - 5) ≥ 50` contain one of the five profiles.
* (C) `many_chains`: at least 7 pairs with `Σ (holes + 6) ≤ 90` have `Σ (rows - holes - 5) ≤ 44`.
* (D) `sum_le_HB`, `kern`, `item_Z`, `item_A1`, `item_A`, `item_B`: the knapsack.
